Once you’ve installed PX-Backup, you’re ready to add any clusters you’d like to back up from and restore to. How you prepare your cluster differs based on its environment. If you're using a cloud-based Kubernetes cluster, you must configure permissions on your cloud provider before adding it to PX-Backup.

Follow the topics in this section to add a cluster.
